## Hi there 👋 , my name is Roberto Gómez
I'm an experienced iOS developer with 10+ years of professional experience in iOS projects (iPhone, iPad, AppleTV, and watchOS). 

During all these years, I have acquired a solid knowledge of object-oriented, protocol-oriented, and functional programming in Swift and Objective-c, applying architectures like MVC, MVVM, Viper, etc. 

Challenges excite me, solving complex problems, refining code to make it cleaner and more efficient, and working closely with teams to bring projects to life. These abilities have been gained by using Agile methodologies and the meculous use of software version control to track and manage changes in our work.

### My Strengths:
- Team Collaboration: I believve in the power of the teamwork and collaboration to achieve remarkable goals.
- Code Refinement: I'm interested in  improving the structure and clarity of code, making it easy to maintain and refactor.
- Problem-solving: Handling and resolving errors is something that motivates, and what I have been working on for all these years.
- Adaptability and Continuous Learning: Staying up-to-date in the lastest iOS development and adapting to the new technoligies and methodologies is part of my growth mindset.
