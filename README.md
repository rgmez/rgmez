## Hi there 👋 , my name is Roberto Gómez
I love building iOS apps that people actually use. I'm lucky that, during my career, I've built apps that reached millions worldwide. Helping users, writing simple code, and making things work better are what keep me excited about my job.             

I’m a Senior iOS Developer with over a decade of hands-on experience, primarily using Swift and SwiftUI to build high-quality, scalable apps.

Over the years, I’ve had the chance to work on international products that reach huge audiences. I get the most satisfaction from focusing on performance, reliability, and great user experiences. I like being close to the product, understanding what people actually need, and finding straightforward ways to solve tough problems.

### My Strengths:
- Team Collaboration: I believe in the power of teamwork and collaboration to achieve remarkable goals.
- Code Refinement: I'm interested in  improving the structure and clarity of code, making it easy to maintain and refactor.
- Problem-solving: Handling and resolving errors is something that motivates me, and what I have been working on for all these years.
- Adaptability and Continuous Learning: Staying up-to-date with the latest iOS development and adapting to new technologies and methodologies is part of my growth mindset.
